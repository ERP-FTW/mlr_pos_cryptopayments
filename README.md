MI Lightning Rod Point of Sale Crypto Payment Base Module Readme

Overview
This custom module for Odoo 16+ adds common fields to payment and payment method models for cryptocurrency payments through the point-of-sale application. This module acts as a base to provide a set of common fields on payment models, extends views to review payment information, and loads these fields into point of sale sessions. This creates easier to manage data that can analyzed regardless of payment provider and simplifies building of provider applications and prevents conflicts. Think of this module as a gear that will fit with further trading and accounts modules, while providers act as motors or widgets. The module will rebrand the point-of-sale by replacing the icon with the MLR logo.
